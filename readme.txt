Stable tag: trunk

Shortcode providing thumbnail gallery of items attached to the current post (i.e. PDFs).

== Description ==

The Attachment Gallery plugin was developed by [Acumen](http://www.acumendevelopment.net/ "Acumen Development")
in order to provide an easy way for users to view and download attachments you've added to your page.

Once the plugin is installed, you will be able to include the attachment gallery in your posts
and pages using the `[attachmentgallery]` shortcode. Any page containing attachments (which Wordpress typically inserts as
HTML links) will have these attachments removed, and a structured HTML gallery containing those attachments inserted
where the shortcode was placed.

Note - requires the free ImageMagick software for thumbnailing - see install section for more details.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Check that ImageMagic is installed - for instance, on Linux you may use `yum -y install ImageMagick-devel` and `pecl install imagick`
1. Upload the plugin to it's own directory within `/wp-content/plugins/`
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Attach some items (i.e. PDFs to a page)
1. Shortcodes can now be added as `[attachmentgallery]` to any of your pages/posts with attachments
1. Contact us with your feedback!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What attachment types are supported for thumbnailing? =

Currently only PDFs are supported, but we are able to expand this easily on request. Immediate upcoming considerations would be
document types such as Word, Excel, Powerpoint and their open source equivalents, along with bitmap image formats such as JPG, PNG, TIFF, and BMP, and vector 
image formats such as PSD and SVG.

= How does Attachment Gallery affect Wordpress =
Most of Attachment Gallery's functionality is provided as template options. However, we do add to the `image_downsize` filter, 
which provides thumbnailing for the types we support (i.e. PDF).

This means that standard Wordpress themes like `twentyten` will show thumbnails on attachment galleries as these pages, if
thumbnailable will be shown as if they were normal image attachments.

= What options are available in the shortcode? =

* `linktopage` - if set, links attachments in the gallery to their own attachment page, rather than the file itself
* `size` - thumbnail size for the gallery
* `grid` - whether to show attachments in a grid form using CSS `float` property
* `metareplace` - allows meta data from the attachment to be replaced by metadata from wordpress. Normally they will both be shown.

For instance:
`[attachmentgallery download="yes" linktopage="yes" size="100x150" metareplace="description=Subject"]`

= How can I style the Galleries? =

You can style them with the CSS classes `attachment_gallery`, `attachment_gallery_item`, `attachment_gallery_item_title` etc, as so:

	.attachment_gallery{
		background-color:#eee;
		border:solid 1px #888;
		padding:10px;
	}
	.attachment_gallery_item{
		background-color:#fff;
		border:solid 1px #888;
		padding:10px;
	}
	.attachment_gallery_item_download{
		text-align:right;
		display:block;
		width:100%;
		margin:5px;
	}
	.attachment_gallery_item_thumbnail{
		border:solid 1px #ccc;
		float:left;
		margin-right:10px;
		width:100px;
	}

= Can I change the order of the HTML gallery elements? =
Not yet, though please get in touch if you'd find this useful.

= What does the actual output HTML look like? =
Like this:

`
    <div class="attachment_gallery">
    	<div class="attachment_gallery_item">
    		<div class="attachment_gallery_item_thumbnail">
    			<a href="http://example.com/my.pdf">
    				<img src="http://example.com/my.pdf/attachment-gallery/thumbnail.php?size=100&file=http://example.com/my.pdf" /> 
    			</a>
    		</div>
    		<a href="http://example.com/my.pdf">
    			PDF Title
    		</a>
    		</div>
    		<dl class="attachment_gallery_meta attachment_gallery_meta_title"> 
    			<dt>Title</dt>
    			<dd><div class="nl">Title extracted from PDF</div></dd> 
    		</dl>
    		<dl class="attachment_gallery_meta attachment_gallery_meta_subject"> 
    			<dt>Subject</dt> <dd><div class="nl">Subject extracted from PDF</div></dd>
    		</dl>
    		<div class="attachment_gallery_item_download">
    			<a href="http://example.com/my.pdf">Download Now</a> 
    		</div> 
    	</div>
